meioKeyboard - a mootools plugin for creating a virtual keyboard.
===========

What goes here is the description. Please don't make it too long. It can contain basic *styling*, **styling**, etc. 

If an image is found within the description, that becomes the screenshot of the plugin. Screenshots are optional but encouraged, given the plugin has some visual interaction. The screenshot can be of any size, but try to keep it of about 200x100.

How to use
----------

We expect this section for every plugin. It just explains how to use your plugin.
Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often include code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	#JS
	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

If the first line is #JS or #CSS or #HTML, then the code is highlighted accordingly. 

Screenshots
-----------

This section is optional, but encouraged if the plugin affords it. Just a list of images, one per line. We do the resizing, so use actual size screenshots.

Arbitrary section
-----------------

This is an arbitrary section which will become a Tab in your MooForge project page. 
Some arbitrary section examples:

* FAQ
* Notes
* Misc
* Known issues

The name is up to you, but remember to keep it meaningful and simple. Arbitrary sections are always optional.
